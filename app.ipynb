      "An F1 Grand Prix is an absolute festival of excitement and entertainment, taking place  over three to four days with all of the warring action culminating in the race itself.  A traditional Grand Prix weekend starts much sooner than that though, with free free practice  sessions taking place over a couple of days before race day to kick things off.  These sessions give the teams and drivers the chance to learn the track, experiment  with the conditions and test the different setups and configurations they want to use  in qualifying and the race. After those practice sessions are completed, it's  time for qualifying. In essence, this is where all the drivers go out and try to  set the fastest possible lap times they can across three knockout sessions Q1, Q2  and Q3. The fastest driver to survive all knockouts starts the race from the very  front of the grid or pole position. Behind them are the other drivers ordered  from qualifying lap times set in the rest of the starting positions for the  race. The cars use a formation lap to line up in their starting or grid  positions on a start finish straight and wait for the lights to go out and the  race begins. So how is the duration of an F1 race decided? It's a case of simple  maths. A Grand Prix distance is 305 kilometers so divide that by the  length of a single lap and round it up to a whole number and hey presto  that's the number of laps for the race. The only exception is if any  stoppages in the race cause it to run over a two-hour time limit. On the final  lap, the first car to cross the finish line and take the checkered flag wins.  Championship points are awarded for all drivers in the top 10 at the end of  the race with 25 points being awarded for first place, just one single point for  10th place plus a point if they set the fastest lap of the race. Drivers  outside the top 10 don't get any points done even if they set the  fastest lap of the race. This traditional F1 race format is a little  different on sprint race weekends however. Teams only have one practice  session before the competitive weekend starts with sprint qualifying and a  shorter race called the F1 sprint with extra points up for grabs. A sprint  weekend happens a few times per season at predetermined races on the  calendar. In some ways, it's like a regular F1 Grand Prix weekend with  practice sessions to start things off and a Grand Prix race to finish. The key  difference on sprint weekends is with fewer practice sessions it makes way for  two exhilarating high tempo sessions, sprint qualifying and the sprint  itself. A short race held the following day. Sprint qualifying decides the  grid order for Saturday sprint. It's a shorter distance designed to be run  with no mandatory pit stops so more or less flat out racing. Only the top  eight finishes in a sprint get points and fewer of them but these extra  points could prove crucial in a tight championship. You might be  surprised to learn that even getting an F1 race started successfully is not at  all a straightforward process. Loads of moving parts and rolls are all  required to work in complete harmony together to put on the show that is  Formula One racing. Let's look at how it all goes down. The cars are moved  from their garages to the grid around 40 to 50 minutes before the race is  due to start. The drivers know which grid slot they need to place their  cars into to get ready for racing. The qualifying session results decide  that. Mechanics and engineers will keep the cars in the shape they need to be  into race whilst they sit on a grid. An F1 grid is also where some of the  world's biggest celebrities, actors, sports stars, musicians and special  guests can be seen amongst the drivers and cars. Once race start time  is approaching, the teams mechanics and crew return to the garage. The  cars roar into life and we begin what's called the formation. This is a  reduced speed tour around the circuit giving the drivers a chance to  check all systems to examine the conditions and crucially warm up  their tires and brakes before race start. F1 cars work best when  those components are just the right temperature. So the formation lap  preparation by a driver can help towards their race start and  opening laps. This is why you see cars driving on the racing line in  single file on a formation lap, avoiding any dust on the dirtier sides  of the track which drivers don't want on their tires potentially  impacting their race start. Once all cars have returned to their  correct starting positions, if all is well, a green flag is waved at  the back of the grid to communicate to the race start to  that everything and everyone is ready to go. Finally, the grand  stands full quiet. Hearts are firmly in mouths and attention  shifts to the start lights above the start finish line as five  red lights come on one by one. Now you might be wondering why  it's red lights going out rather than a green light to start the  race. When red and green lights were used in the past, the red  lights would go out and then green lights would start the  race a bit like your standard traffic lights for road cars.  But here's a fun fact. Most drivers don't actually look  directly at the lights at race start. They keep them in  their periphery and focus on the track which meant that because  of a minute pause between red lights extinguishing and green  lights coming on, drivers learned that they could react more  quickly to the red lights going off rather than waiting for  the green. As a result of the green lights essentially  becoming redundant, they were removed from the grid start  procedure. But in terms of the race start procedure, as  soon as those lights go out, it's race time. There are  times when a race start needs to be aborted. This could  happen for many different reasons. From a car breaking down  on the grid, to there being a technical issue with  officiating equipment like the lights or timing equipment, or  of course, a drastic change in the weather conditions. If a  start does end up being aborted, the cars slowly lap the  circuit, just like on the formation lap, with no  overtaking allowed. In the event of bad weather or  reduced visibility, there is also the option of the race  starting behind the safety car until it's deemed safe to  race normally. Whether it's pirates or train drivers or  battleships, flags have been used as a form of visual  communication for centuries. So why does something as  technologically advanced as Formula One use this seemingly  archaic system in its racing? It's the quickest,  simplest and easiest form of communication if you need to  get a message to all 20 racing drivers in one go. Think of  motor sports flags as like a very basic language, with  different flags used to communicate key messages to  drivers visually as they travel at super fast speed  around the track. These days it's not just flags. The  same system is supported by track side electronic  boards and driver dash displays on their steering  wheels. This just makes it easier to not miss any  messages and have them being displayed in more  areas of the track. So what do all of the F1 flags  mean? Let's start with one of the more commonly  seen yellow flags. A single yellow flag is waved when  there is an incident in the section of track ahead  and tells the driver to reduce their speed and be  prepared to navigate a hazard ahead. No overtaking is  allowed during any yellow flag conditions and it  must be obvious that drivers have slowed their  speed or they face being penalized. A double  waved yellow flag means that drivers must reduce  their speed significantly or be ready to stop. This  may be because of a blockage on the track ahead  or marshals either on or beside the track. If a  single or double yellow flag is waved during  qualifying drivers should abandon their current  lap and visibly demonstrate they have done so by  slowing down. A slight catch being that as yellow  flags can be section specific that might not  affect every driver trying to put in a fast lap  depending on where in the lap they are when  the flag or flags are waved. Which means  sometimes an element of luck either good or  bad can help or hinder a driver during  quality when a yellow flag is waved. In some  cases during a double yellow flag period the  race director may impose a full course yellow  or fcy. This means that yellow flag rules  apply to the entirety of the track until  further notice. A yellow flag with red  stripes is used to show drivers that the  section of track ahead has suffered a  significant reduction in grip. Due to  something like an oil spillage or excess  water a big drop in grip can have pretty  big consequences at f1 speeds. What  follows a yellow flag once a car is  past the affected area of the track or  when the issue is resolved completely is  a green flag. Green flag equals clear to  go racing. Easy. So go go go! A red flag  means slow down immediately and prepare  to stop while returning slowly and  carefully to the pit lane with no  overtaking permitted. The red flag is  most commonly used in the event the  circuit is deemed temporarily unraceable.  A red flag neutralizes the race,  preserving current race positions while  pausing the action to allow any  problems to be cleared up. Then we have  the blue flag which can be a common  thing to spot during a session. A blue  flag's meaning differs based on the  type of session. During free practice  and qualifying a blue flag indicates to  a driver that faster cars are  approaching behind or when they are  leaving the pit lane. When shown  during a race the blue flag is shown  to a driver or drivers that are  about to be lapped. When shown the  driver must allow the approaching  car or cars to pass at the  earliest opportunity. A black and  white flag is used for unsportsmanlike  behavior, overly aggressive or  unsafe driving but more commonly  applied as an exceeding track limits  warning. This flag tells the driver  there on their final warning before  being given a time penalty. The  rarely seen black flag with an orange  dot or the meatball flag if you're  feeling particularly hungry is a way  of warning a driver that their car  has damage and must return to the  pits for repairs. Much like my  grandmother's bolognese, the meatball  black flag with an orange dot is  final. Once it's shown a driver will  incur severe penalties if they fail  to enter the pit for repairs. A full  completely black flag is something no  driver wants to see. It means the  end of a driver's race and not in a  good way. It means the driver is  disqualified and must return to the  pits immediately. The ultimate  shame. They could be disqualified for  their on-track behavior or a  technical infringement by the team  might have been discovered. Either  way, a black flag is terminal. Then  there is of course the checkered  flag. In practice and qualifying it  means times up. Laptimes are  recorded until drivers see the flag  but once they pass this flag they  must return to the pits. For the  race though the checkered flag  signals glory. It's waved at the  finish line to the driver who  completes the race distance first  and then every driver behind them.  The F1 safety car isn't just  something nice to look at, which  it most definitely is. It's an  essential part of hosting a  successful and safe event. The  race director decides when to  deploy the safety car and it's  generally used when an incident is  deemed too serious to be dealt with  via the flag system alone and it's  time to get the big guns out. Once  deployed the safety car enters the  circuit from the pit lane and the  car in first place must then follow  the safety car around at reduced  speed while the rest of the pack  follows behind. No overtaking is  permitted under safety car  conditions and drivers must drive  about the same speed as the car  in front. This will help make for a  tight pack of cars moving around the  circuit at relatively low speed  while any incidents can be dealt with.  Safes houses. Any driver getting too  close or too far from the cars around  them will be penalized. Once an  incident has been cleared the race  director will instruct the safety  car driver on when they're expected  to return to the pits. As the safety  car peels away into the pit lane the  car in first place dictates and  controls the pace of the rest of the  pack. A driver is forbidden from  overtaking until their car passes the  safety car line. A white line on the  track that is usually placed around  the beginning of the start finish  making for a pretty tense and  strategic restart where a race can be  won and lost on the finest margins.  A virtual safety car or VSC is another  way the race director can neutralize a  race in the event of an incident. A  VSC applies to the whole circuit  and limits the drivers to a set  slower variable speed limit and  lap time. The race director might use  the VSC in situations that don't  warrant a full safety car but need  something more than double-waved  yellow flags. The benefit of a VSC  over a regular safety car is that it  preserves the gaps between the cars.  If a driver has a huge lead and a  regular safety car is deployed that  driver will lose the lead they've  built up because all cars are  required to line up single file  behind the safety car. With a VSC  all drivers are capped to the same  minimum lap time but without a  physical safety car on track meaning  that any gaps between cars will be  more or less preserved as they are.  Let's summarize. We've learned about  all the different flags used to send  messages to drivers in the race  qualifying or practice session to keep  them safe and playing by the rules.  When they're not enough there's the  safety car and virtual safety car.  These are all used in regular and  shorter sprint races which have  different weekend formats but both  formats have a grid determined by  qualifying with pole position at the  front and the same race start  procedure of five lights coming on then  going out to signal to the drivers it's  time to race. Let's go!\n"
